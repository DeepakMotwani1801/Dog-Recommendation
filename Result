Evaluation metric :- F1 Score

Reason to choose F1 score

The F1 score is a measure of the balance between precision and recall. It is
calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. A high F1 score
indicates that the recommendation system is providing both relevant and
accurate recommendations. 

So our Models Average precision was equal to 87.5% and the Average Recall was 85%

F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
F1 Score = 2 * (0.875 * 0.85) / (0.875 + 0.85)
F1 Score = 0.8629 or 86.29%
